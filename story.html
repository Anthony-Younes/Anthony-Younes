        <h2 class="center">What Got Me to Workout?</h2>
        <p>I've always had an interest in sports, participating in football, kung-fu, and swimming as a child. I am fortunate to have supportive parents who guided me through my journey. Despite this, I was skinny and had a negative perception of the gym. I thought it was something "unnatural" and only for bodybuilders. So, when my best friend Fouad suggested going to the gym, my initial response was an instant no. I believed the myth that the gym was only for adults.</p>
        <p>However, after doing some research, I saw how important and valuable working out is. I was convinced. Therefore, on August 18, 2022, I joined my first gym in Lebanon after hours of convincing the owner to let me in since they thought I was "too young." At that time, I was one day away from turning 13. Two weeks later, I returned to Egypt, as I only visit Lebanon in the summer. I was new at my school in Egypt and not very popular.</p>
        <p>There was a kid in my class named Zack who seemed cool, and I wanted to get to know him since I didn't have many friends. It turns out he was going to the gym and looking for a gym partner. You guessed itâ€”I started going to the gym with him, and he had other people join us as well. This made the gym fun and introduced me to a lot of people at my new school. I began to look forward to the gym sessions.</p>
        <p>According to a book I am reading now, <i>Atomic Habits</i>, to make a new habit, you have to make it fun and rewarding. By luck, that happened to me. Unconsciously, I didn't go to the gym simply to work out; it was also to make connections and get to know friends. However, after all these people at the gym quit and stopped coming, Zack and I continued. I was already used to going six times a week to the gym, and from there, we stayed consistent and focused on working out.</p>

      <div class="sections">
        <h2 class="center">My Discoveries / Advice:</h2>
        <p>I am very thankful that I had the opportunity to associate the gym with a positive experience (in my case, meeting friends). I believe it would be beneficial for you to do the same.</p>
        <p>Always do what feels best and what you enjoy the most. However, if you are new, experiment with methods that have worked for others.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality over quantity:</strong> For muscle growth, focus on controlling the reps and truly feeling the exercise. Ego lifting will limit your progress and increase the risk of injury.</p>
        <p><strong>Compare yourself only to yourself:</strong> Most people you see on social media have expensive cameras, perfect lighting, good genetics, and possibly use steroids. Keep grinding, work on yourself, and don't beat yourself up over comparisons.</p>
        <p><strong>Put all your energy into every set:</strong> Your muscles need to believe you are performing a critical action for survival, which signals them to grow. If you aren't training to failure, you're wasting your time and energy.</p>
        <p><strong>Nutrition and sleep are as important as working out:</strong> Don't expect significant results if your diet is poor or your sleep schedule is irregular.</p>
        <p><strong>Nobody cares:</strong> Don't let your thoughts and social anxiety limit you. Just do it. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose.</p>
        <p>Personally, I do 1-2 sets on each exercise, and usually I incorporate a drop-set till failure.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sections">
        <h2 class="center">Myths:</h2>
        <p><strong>Working out at a young age stunts growth:</strong> There is no scientific evidence to prove this theory. Moreover, I started weight-training at 13 years old, and I have reached the predicted height my doctor told me. If you have a nutritious diet, a good sleep schedule, and good form with no ego-lifting, you have nothing to worry about.</p>
        <p><strong>You need supplements to gain muscle:</strong> In the beginning of my journey, I took protein powder. However, after discovering that natural food like steak, chicken, potato, and rice do the same job, and maybe even better, I stopped all supplements. Supplements are only there to help you, but if you have access to good, clean, nutritious food, you have no need to use supplements.</p>
        <p><strong>Cardio makes you lose gains:</strong> Cardio is an essential part of fitness and can even help with muscle recovery. Never use this as an excuse.</p>
        <p><strong>Lifting weights makes you bulky:</strong> Especially common among women, this myth suggests that lifting weights will lead to an overly muscular physique. Building significant muscle mass requires specific training and nutrition. For most people, weightlifting helps tone and strengthen muscles without excessive bulk.</p>
        <p><strong>You can lose fat from a specific area of your body by targeting it with exercises:</strong> Fat loss occurs throughout the body and can't be targeted to specific areas through exercise alone. A combination of overall fat loss and strength training is more effective.</p>
        <p><strong>No pain, no gain:</strong> The myth suggests you need to feel pain during or after your workout to see results. While some discomfort is normal, especially when starting a new routine, pain is often a sign of injury. Effective workouts should challenge you without causing harm.</p>
        <p><strong>You should work out every day:</strong> To see results, you need to exercise every day without rest. In reality, rest and recovery are crucial for muscle repair and growth. Overtraining can lead to injury and burnout.</p>
        <p><strong>More sweat equals a better workout:</strong> The more you sweat, the more effective your workout. Sweating is your body's way of cooling down and doesn't necessarily correlate with workout intensity or effectiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>You need to spend hours in the gym:</strong> Longer workouts are better. Quality is more important than quantity. Effective workouts can be completed in as little as 30 minutes if they are well-structured.</p>
        <p><strong>Muscle turns into fat if you stop working out:</strong> Muscle will turn into fat when you stop exercising. Muscle and fat are different tissues and cannot transform into each other. Inactivity can lead to muscle loss and potential fat gain, but they are separate processes.</p>
        <p><strong>You have to eat protein immediately after working out:</strong> There's a very short "anabolic window" post-workout where you must consume protein. While post-workout nutrition is important, the overall daily intake of protein is more crucial. The anabolic window is longer than often suggested.</p>
        <p><strong>Machines are safer than free weights:</strong> Exercise machines are safer and more effective than free weights. Both machines and free weights have their place. Free weights often provide a more functional workout by engaging stabilizing muscles, while machines can be good for isolating specific muscles and for beginners.</p>
